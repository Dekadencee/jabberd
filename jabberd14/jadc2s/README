jadc2s - jabberd client-to-server connection manager

This is a simple daemon that manages incoming connections from clients.  It handles parsing the appropriate parts of the stream to process authentication requests and which connections have been authorized as a valid session.

The internals right now are stripped from the jabberd-1.4 release, consisting of a simple main select loop that processes the socket events, and callbacks in expat to track incoming packets to handle them as auth or deliver them to a session manager.

For testing what's here you need jabberd-1.4.2, then create a file called c2s.xml that contains:
<service id="jadc2s">
  <accept>
    <ip/>
    <port>5111</port>
    <secret>secret</secret>
  </accept>
</service>

And start 1.4.2 with the command line: ./jabberd/jabberd -h yourhostname -i c2s.xml

Now, edit jadc2s.xml to your liking, then start jadc2s:
    ./jadc2s

By default, it will listen for new connections on port 5221 (for testing).
