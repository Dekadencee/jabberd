/* This module is not yet written, but scheduled to be ASAP */

/* mod_groups allows users and/or administrators to form "groups" of users on a server
 * these groups share special properties
 * the primary use is to auto-maintain a "group" in everyones roster, where a new user being added to the group is added to everyones roster
 * the presence subscriptions would automatically be put in place
 * these groups can also be used administratively to manage users, and be flexibly controled by the users
 * mod_groups would present itself as an agent with sub-agents for each public group
 * any user can register with a sub-agent and the server will add that group to their roster
 * groups are PER-SERVER only, and cannot contain users not on this server!
