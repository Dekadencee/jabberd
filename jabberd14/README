Welcome to the world of Jabber 1.2RC!

This is a Release Candidate, and although the software is nearing release, the polished README's and documentation needs some attention yet :)

-----------------------

  To build, run "./configure" and then type "make"

  Optional: edit jabber.xml, edit the <host> section near the top to replace "localhost", edit other values as desired

  To start, ./jabberd/jabberd -h your.domain.name

  Optional: for lots of debug output, use the -D flag
  Optional: to specify a config file other than ./jabber.xml, use -c /path/to/file.xml

-----------------------

If it starts up (just sits there), you should be able to connect to the domain name you used with any client and register new users.

If anything goes awry, feel free to email bug reports to bugs@jabber.org, including your config file (if you've made any significant changes), -D debug output, and a backtrace if it cored

We're working on documentation in the docs/ folder, and if you find any rough areas or problems on any platforms or environments, we're looking for any and all assistance in making this a smooth release!

Latest CVS is always available as "jabber2" on jabber.org.
