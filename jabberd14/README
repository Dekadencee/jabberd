Welcome to the world of Jabber 1.1.1!

This is going to be short, experts only, to be filled in by later development releases:

To build, type "make"

To configure, edit jabber.xml, edit the <host> section near the top to replace "localhost", edit other values as desired

To start, ./jabberd/jabberd

For lots of debug output, use the -D flag

If it starts up (just sits there), you should be able to connect and register new users, most of the 1.0 functionality should work

If anything goes awry, feel free to email bug reports to bugs@jabber.org, including your config file (if you've made any significant changes), -D debug output, and a backtrace if it cored

For any more details, consult the source :)

Latest CVS is always available as "jabber2" on jabber.org.
