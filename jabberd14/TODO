Crit/Bugs/Strangeness
===================================

temas	9/15/00 almost
flat jpolld component minimally working

jer	9/15/00 thinking
consistent usage of namespaces for streams and config sections

keith/temas	10/5/00 oops!
c2s components must support configurable aliases, <alias to="jabber.org">www.jabber.org</alias>
so that a client who types in www.jabber.org and that shows up in the stream header, it's translated to just jabber.org internally
should we probably also have it conifgurable so that all names are forced to one?

===================================

keith --
mod_filter rule caching

jer --
jsm roster caching and hashing?

keith 9/26/00 ----
base_accept plumber algorithm needs improvement..
perhaps a timout for each individual packet?

temas	9/15/00 owner
minimal build system?
static/dynamic for base modules, components?

jer	9/15/00 need to document
dialback hostname authentication using signatures

jer	9/15/00 owner
jsm should manage stateless sessions too

jer	9/15/00 need to document
zero-knowledge auth plugin

jer	9/15/00 easy
base_cache for caching xdb requests in memory

?	9/15/00 open, needs some docu from jer
base_farm for simple hashing name distribution

jer/diz	10/4/00 grunt
rate limits

all	10/5/00 cleanup
existing/known bugs or issues with 1.0, protocol things?
register get

===================================
TESTING
===================================

base modules:
	base_accept, filtering, void, queue timeouts
	base_connect, chaining, queueing and reconnecting
	base_exec, restarting, proper shutdown?
	base_stdout, chaining, xdb/log/stderr/debug handling?
	logging: file, formatting, forwarding
	xdb: seperating namespaces

overall:
	mem leaks, watching pool debug
	performance

components:
	dnsrv, general SRV and A testing
	s2s, timeouts, drops, 1.0/1.2
	jsm, virtual hosting
	xdb_file, io error handling, heavy load?
	c2s, bad streams/ids, bad auth, bad reg, queueing, timeouts


===================================
1.2
===================================

jer 9/26/00 future junk
A way to gracefully shut down the server, and notify all components is needed

dizzyd	9/15/00 owner
test python scripts, "make test"

?	9/15/00
need nice READMEs and man page(s)

jer	9/15/00
deliver safety, validating routable bits of the packets
deliver optimization

all	9/15/00
clean up log_* calls, make sure right type, looks sane
check XXX/TODO comment flags
check error codes, use timeout ones?

jer	9/15/00
socket ioctl tweaks, r/w buffers, reduce data loss, shorten timeouts


===================================
1.3/1.4
===================================

jer	9/15/00 owner
config: register a command description like apache?

pthreads
admin
dynamic config
smarter failure handling and detection (component keepalive?)

===================================
Future
===================================
