config: register a command description like apache?

temas	9/15/00 almost
jpolld component minimally working

sheath	9/15/00 in progress
s2s SRV dns lookup support

jer	9/15/00 thinking
consistent usage of namespaces for streams and config sections

===================================
Pre-FFreeze
===================================

keith 9/26/00 ----
base_accept plumber algorithm needs improvement..
perhaps a timout for each individual packet?

temas	9/15/00 owner
minimal build system?
static/dynamic for base modules, components?

jer	9/15/00 dreaming
base_dns module to do smart protocol choice filtering based on SRV records
allow component to use sto to manipulate decisions?
timeouts? mx?

jer	9/15/00 need to document
dialback hostname authentication using signatures

jer	9/15/00 owner
turn jsm into a SM only, branch off auth/reg
manage stateless sessions too, change to sid for routing/validation?

jer	9/15/00 need to document
zero-knowledge auth plugin

jer	9/15/00 easy
base_cache for caching xdb requests in memory

?	9/15/00 open, needs some docu from jer
base_farm for simple hashing name distribution


===================================

===================================

jer 9/26/00 future junk
A way to gracefully shut down the server, and notify all components is needed

dizzyd	9/15/00 owner
test python scripts, "make test"

?	9/15/00
need nice READMEs and man page(s)

all	9/15/00
mem leak checks
performance analysis

jer	9/15/00
deliver safety, validating routable bits of the packets
deliver optimization

all	9/15/00
clean up log_* calls, make sure right type, looks sane

jer	9/15/00
socket ioctl tweaks, r/w buffers, reduce data loss, shorten timeouts

someone 9/26/00
figure out a way to let the dns component know we already have an open
socket to a server, so it doesn't have to keep looking it up all the time

===================================
1.3/1.4
===================================

pthreads
admin
dynamic config
smarter failure handling and detection (component keepalive?)

Future
