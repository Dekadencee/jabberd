jsm roster caching

keith 9/26/00 ----
base_accept plumber algorithm needs improvement..
perhaps a timout for each individual packet?

temas	9/15/00 owner
minimal build system?
static/dynamic for base modules, components?

jer	9/15/00 need to document
dialback hostname authentication using signatures

jer	9/15/00 owner
jsm should manage stateless sessions too

jer	9/15/00 need to document
zero-knowledge auth plugin

jer	9/15/00 easy

jer	9/15/00
deliver safety, validating routable bits of the packets
deliver optimization

all	9/15/00
clean up log_* calls, make sure right type, looks sane

jer	9/15/00
socket ioctl tweaks, r/w buffers, reduce data loss, shorten timeouts
