jabberd is a daemon administrating and coordinating the flow of data within the server architecture
jabberd consists of base modules which implement the execution environment of components within the server architecture
the logic for constructing the architecture, managing the components, and coordinating the flow of data is governed by the configuration file

base modules may:
	handle configuration commands within the context of an instance
	relate an instance to the delivery logic
	handle packets within the context of an instance
	genrate new packets for delivery

packets are routed based on the host in the to or sid attributes
packets are logicly delivered into three categories: log, xdb, normal

DizzyD's Explanation Attempt #1

jabberd is the hub of a distributed system of components which, collectively, form a single Jabber server. Currently,
these components connect to the server via the following methods:
    - TCP sockets
    - Child process I/O (stdin/out)
    - Shared object/libraries

jabberd acts as a central-coordinator between these components. It does this by routing/delivering the XML packets
which the components exchange. This design permits the jabber server to be effectively scaled across a server
farm, while providing signficant freedom in implementation of the pieces which compose the server. An existing,
dedicated LDAP server can be fitted with a component which hooks up to the jabberd hub via TCP sockets. Authentication,
vcard lookups, etc, on arrival in the hub are passed down the TCP connection to the LDAP server for handling in 
whatever form it sees fit. Thus, jabberd provides a way to custom-fit a jabberserver to an existing network topology.

Codewise, jabberd is quite simplistic (ok, so it's not to me, but this is written with the future in mind). There
are six basic C files which compose the heart of jabberd:
    1.) jabberd.c   - Starts the hub and loads configuration
    2.) config.c    - Configuration parser and loader
    3.) deliver.c   - Delivery logic for the server; maintains 3 logical delivery trees
    4.) heartbeat.c - Uh..heartbeat? What the sam shake is this used for?
    5.) load.c      - intializes base modules and loads any registered shared object libraries
    6.) log.c       - provides interface for logging errors, warnings, etc.

Note that these files provide little functionality on their own. They only form the core of the jabberd process
and rely on base modules to provide significant functionality (such as opening TCP connections, loading shared 
objects, listening for incoming TCP connections, etc). 

The base modules can be found in four child directories of jabberd/src:
    * log/  - Base modules specific to logging
    * xdb/  - Base modules specific to xdb (xml node storage)
    * io/   - Base modules specific to IO (TCP, file, shared objects)
    * gen/  - Base modules which provide general functionality 

-- Server Logic Guide --

I.) Startup
    The server starts up by locating and loading an XML configuration file. This file provides information on all
    the various components which will compose the server. Logically, each component which forms the server can
    be put into one of the following categories:
    1.) xdb     - an XDB component provides a way to store/query xml nodes
    2.) log     - logging components provide storage/output facilities for logging information
    3.) service - ?!
    
    **WARNING**
    It should be noted that it is quite possible to setup a seriously screwed up server by tinkering with this file. 
    Infinite message loops are the least troublesome of the problems which this amount of flexibilty brings. That 
    said, this approach to setting up the server affords significant scalability and modularity. Let he who has ears, 
    take heed. 
    **WARNING**

II.) Delivery/Routing
    As the hub in a jabber server, jabberd is responsible for ensuring that packets are properly routed between
    the various components. Packets which pass through jabberd can be categorized into three classes:
    1.) xdb          - a packet containing data which will query or store data in an xdb component
    2.) log          - a packet containing logging information
    3.) (all others) - a packet which contains any other type of information (ex. messages, presence, etc)

    For each of these three categories, there exists a delivery tree within jabberd that tracks the various
    components interested in each type of request. Components register interest in a certain packet category
    by the way in which they are defined within the XML configuration file.
    
    

III.) Crashing (How various components handle it and restart)
