===================================
Features/Crit
===================================

temas
jpolld component

jer
mod_roster caching and hashing?
mod_filter rule caching
dialback hostname authentication using sha
jsm should manage stateless sessions too
zero-knowledge auth plugin and auth/reg system cleanup
xdb_file in-mem caching

keith
base_accept plumber algorithm needs improvement..
perhaps a timout for each individual packet?

?
base_farm meshing and hashed jid distribution

jer/diz
rate limits


===================================
Code Double Checks
===================================

consistent jabber:* namespaces and checks
clean up log_* calls, make sure right type, looks sane
check XXX/TODO comment flags
check error codes, use timeout ones?


===================================
TESTING
===================================

base modules:
	base_accept, filtering, void, queue timeouts
	base_connect, chaining, queueing and reconnecting
	base_exec, restarting, proper shutdown?
	base_stdout, chaining, xdb/log/stderr/debug handling?
	logging: file, formatting, forwarding
	xdb: seperating namespaces

overall:
	mem leaks, watching pool debug
	performance

components:
	dnsrv, general SRV and A testing
	s2s, timeouts, drops, 1.0/1.2
	jsm, virtual hosting
	xdb_file, io error handling, heavy load?
	c2s, bad streams/ids, bad auth, bad reg, queueing, timeouts

builds:
	XP to gcc on linux/solaris2.6+/*bsd
	personal
	intranet/internal
	isp/general
	developer


===================================
1.2 Cleanup/Release
===================================

all
existing/known bugs or issues with 1.0, protocol things?

jer
A way to gracefully shut down the server, and notify all components is needed
deliver safety, validating routable bits of the packets
deliver optimization/logic review

dizzyd
test python scripts, "make test"

?
need nice READMEs and man page(s)
socket ioctl tweaks, r/w buffers, reduce data loss, shorten timeouts


===================================
1.3/1.4+
===================================

config: register a command description like apache?
pthreads
admin
dynamic config
smarter failure handling and detection (component keepalive?)
managed IO: mio_* w/ pluggable select/poll/aio in the background and smart xmlnode/char* write buffering
pth_msgport replacement w/ socketpair and fd events for easier pthread handling
