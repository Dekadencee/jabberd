fix deliver() to handle built-in xdb requests, from="" attrib is ignored
	to get config data as a namespace in service config section, use "config@_internal" as the to="" attrib

fix delivery so that when there are multiple deliveries or instances, the packet is copied, so expensive copying is reduced when not needed and modules need not worry about copying, can just OWN the packet if they deliver it

register function for heartbeat with frequency, have heartbeat timer thread firing registered functions

base_accept/connect
	have one delivery handler registered
	buffer all packets to common sink
	the write thread can check/block on getting packets from that sink
	when there is no write thread, they just accumulate
	heartbeat to check/warn/bounce from sink
	to exchange secret, send <secret>HASH</secret> and accept will respond with <secret/> or disconnect with a stream:error if failed
	no "host" identity exchanged, must be configured on each side
	for connect, cleanup on death to attempt reconnect frequently
