Welcome to the world of Jabber 1.2!

This README is very sparse, look for an updated Server-HOWTO at http://docs.jabber.org/ if this is insufficient.
There is also an UPGRADE document included detailing the steps in upgrading from the old 1.0 server.

-----------------------

  First, untar or move this folder into the final install location (such as /usr/local/jabber)

  To build, run "./configure" and then type "make"

  Optional: edit jabber.xml, edit the <host> section near the top to replace "localhost" (or just use the -h flag below), edit other values as desired

  To start:
    ./jabberd/jabberd -h your.domain.name &

  Optional: for lots of debug output, use the -D flag
  Optional: to specify a config file other than ./jabber.xml, use -c /path/to/file.xml

  Error messages are written to the ./error.log and copied to STDERR.

  To test operation, connect to the domain name you used with any client and register new users.

-----------------------

If anything goes awry, feel free to email bug reports to bugs@jabber.org, including your config file (if you've made any significant changes) and -D debug output.
We're working on documentation in the docs/ folder and at http://docs.jabber.org.  If there are any rough areas or problems on any platforms or environments, please feel free to report them and assist us in correcting it.
